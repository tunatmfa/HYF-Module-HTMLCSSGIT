1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

mkdir .HiddenFolder.txt creates a hidden folder named HiddenFolder.

touch .HiddenFile.txt creates a hidden file named HiddenFile.

I can display hidden files by typing ls -a

2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

I can create multiple nested directories by writing mkdir -p. In other words I can create four folders by mkdir -p parent/child1/child2/child3

3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

echo "first message" >> read.txt

$ cat read.txt
first message

$ echo "second message" >> read.txt

$ cat read.txt
first message
second message
